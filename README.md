## Problem Statement

Premagic provides specialized tools, including a CRM system, for photographers and event organizers. Despite being available as a progressive web app (PWA), accessing the CRM on mobile devices poses challenges. The web-based interface on smaller screens leads to usability issues and inefficiencies. This results in frustration and delays for team members in completing tasks, affecting their overall CRM experience. To solve these problems, we need an Android CRM application.

## Proposed Solution

In response to the challenges faced by users accessing Premagic's CRM system on mobile devices, we propose the development of a cross-platform mobile application. This solution focuses on delivering a seamless and intuitive user experience, prioritizing simplicity and ease of use. Leveraging cross-platform development technologies like React Native, the app will ensure broad compatibility on both iOS and Android devices. It will feature a minimalistic UI design for easy navigation, catering to busy team members' needs for quick access to essential functions. Seamless integration with Premagic's CRM system will provide access to all core features, and continuous refinement through iterative development cycles and collaborative feedback sessions will ensure the app meets the evolving needs of users.

## Key Features
